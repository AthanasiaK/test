# Abstract {#sec-abstract}

Large-scale entertainment events, such as concerts and festivals, introduce a sudden influx of irregular travelers into urban environments, placing temporary but intense pressure on transportation systems. This study presents a structured framework for analyzing the mobility impacts of such events, using multimodal data and behavioral insights. Starting with event-specific inputsâ€”such as venue capacity, fanbase demographics, and transportation availabilityâ€”we apply data cleaning and processing techniques to estimate modal splits, analyze demand surges, and assess traffic patterns. A representative case from Taylor Swiftâ€™s Eras Tour illustrates how public transit, ride-hailing services, and private vehicles respond to high-attendance scenarios, with notable congestion and speed reductions observed near key access routes. The findings inform policy recommendations focused on demand management strategies and multimodal coordination. This framework is designed to be scalable and adaptable across different cities and event types, supporting evidence-based planning for future special events.

# Introduction {#sec-intro}

Most of us have attended a planned special event such as a concert or a sports game. But have we ever considered how these events impact the transportation systems of our cities?

Irregular travelers, such as attendees of special events, can cause excessive road traffic and public transportation crowding, undermining the appeal and effectiveness of public transportation. This paper investigates the transportation effects of Taylor Swiftâ€™s Eras Tour in Chicago (June 2â€“4, 2023), using multimodal data to understand travel behavior and system stress.

## Research Questions
ğŸš—ğŸšŒ How do attendees of special events contribute to road traffic and public transportation crowding?

ğŸš§ What can authorities do better to reduce overall congestion and improve transportation planning?

# Case Study: Chicago Concerts {#sec-case}

# Speed Analysis {#sec-modal}

```{python}
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
from ipywidgets import interact, IntRangeSlider

# Load your data
df = pd.read_csv("output_average_speed_with_percentage_difference583.csv")

# Function to plot based on selected hour range
def plot_speed(hour_range):
    start_hour, end_hour = hour_range

    # Filter data for selected hours
    mask = (df["Hour"] >= start_hour) & (df["Hour"] <= end_hour)

    # Speed for June 2
    speed_0206 = df[(df["Day_x"] == "2023-06-02") & mask].set_index("Hour")["SPEED_x"]

    # Mean speed for other days
    mean_speed_exclude_0206 = df[(df["Day_x"] != "2023-06-02") & mask].groupby("Hour")["SPEED_x"].mean()

    # Reindex to match
    speed_0206 = speed_0206.reindex(mean_speed_exclude_0206.index)

    # Plotting
    plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
    plt.plot(speed_0206.index, speed_0206.values, label="June 2, 2023", c='r', linewidth=3, marker='o')
    plt.plot(mean_speed_exclude_0206.index, mean_speed_exclude_0206.values, label="Mean (Other Days)", linestyle="--", linewidth=3)

    plt.xlabel("Hour of the Day")
    plt.ylabel("Speed (mph)")
    plt.title(f"Traffic Speed Comparison ({start_hour}:00â€“{end_hour}:00)")
    plt.legend()
    plt.grid(True)
    plt.tight_layout()
    plt.show()

# Create interactive slider
interact(plot_speed, hour_range=IntRangeSlider(value=[16, 23], min=0, max=23, step=1, description='Hour Range'))
