# Introduction {#sec-intro}

This test paper demonstrates the use of **cross-referencing** in Quarto documents. It includes sections, tables, figures, and code blocks with labels for academic-style referencing.

Refer to the results in @sec-results and the conclusion in @sec-conclusion.

# Methodology {#sec-method}

We use Python to generate tables and simulate data. Tables and figures are labeled for referencing. See @tbl-planets and @fig-elephant for examples.

# Results {#sec-results}

## Code-Generated Table

The following table presents data on astronomical objects. Reference: @tbl-planets.

```{python}
#| label: tbl-planets
#| tbl-cap: Astronomical object data
