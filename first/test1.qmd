# Introduction {#sec-intro}

This paper explores the concept of **lane-free traffic**, where vehicles are not constrained by traditional lane markings. This approach aims to improve traffic flow and safety, especially in complex environments like roundabouts and intersections.

The concept is inspired by the artificial-fluid model introduced in @lanefreepaper2021, which treats traffic as a continuous flow rather than discrete lane-based streams.

# Simulation Setup {#sec-setup}

We simulate a lane-free traffic scenario using a simplified model. The parameters are summarized in Table @tbl-simparams, which outlines the number of vehicles, simulation duration, and control method used.

## Simulation Parameters

| Parameter         | Value        |
|------------------|--------------|
| Vehicle Count     | 100          |
| Simulation Time   | 300 seconds  |
| Control Method    | Artificial Fluid Model |

## Vehicle Density Over Time

The figure below (Figure @fig-flowchart) shows how vehicle density changes over time during the simulation. This visualization helps assess the stability and flow of traffic under lane-free conditions.

# Conclusion {#sec-conclusion}

This test paper demonstrates how to structure a Quarto document with citations, labeled tables, and figures. The lane-free traffic model, as proposed in @lanefreepaper2021, offers a promising direction for future mobility systems. The simulation parameters in Table @tbl-simparams and the results shown in Figure @fig-flowchart support the feasibility of this approach.
